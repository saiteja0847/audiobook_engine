1|Conscription Day is always the deadliest.|NARRATOR|N|tense
2|Maybe that’s why the sunrise is especially beautiful this morning—because I know it might be my last.|NARRATOR|N|tense
3|I tighten the straps of my heavy canvas rucksack and trudge up the wide staircase of the stone fortress I call home.|NARRATOR|N|tense
4|My chest heaves with exertion, my lungs burning by the time I reach the stone corridor leading to General Sorrengail’s office.|NARRATOR|N|tense
5|This is what six months of intense physical training has given me—the ability to barely climb six flights of stairs with a thirty-pound pack.|NARRATOR|N|tense
6|I’m so fucked.|NARRATOR|N|bitter
7|The thousands of twenty-year-olds waiting outside the gate to enter their chosen quadrant for service are the smartest and strongest in Navarre.|NARRATOR|N|tense
8|Hundreds of them have been preparing for the Riders Quadrant, the chance to become one of the elite, since birth.|NARRATOR|N|tense
9|I’ve had exactly six months.|NARRATOR|N|tense
10|The expressionless guards lining the wide hallway at the top of the landing avoid my eyes as I pass, but that’s nothing new.|NARRATOR|N|tense
11|Besides, being ignored is the best possible scenario for me.|NARRATOR|N|tense
12|Basgiath War College isn’t known for being kind to…well, anyone, even those of us whose mothers are in command.|NARRATOR|N|tense
13|Every Navarrian officer, whether they choose to be schooled as healers, scribes, infantry, or riders, is molded within these cruel walls over three years, honed into weapons to secure our mountainous borders from the violent invasion attempts of the kingdom of Poromiel and their gryphon riders.|NARRATOR|N|tense
14|The weak don’t survive here, especially not in the Riders Quadrant.|NARRATOR|N|tense
15|"You’re sending her to die!" a familiar voice thunders through the general’s thick wooden door, and I gasp.|NARRATOR|N|fearful
16|There’s only one woman on the Continent foolish enough to raise her voice to the general, but she’s supposed to be on the border with the Eastern Wing.|NARRATOR|N|fearful
17|Mira.|NARRATOR|N|fearful
18|There’s a muffled response from the office, and I reach for the door handle.|NARRATOR|N|tense
19|"She doesn’t stand a chance," Mira shouts as I force the heavy door open and the weight of my pack shifts forward, nearly taking me down.|MIRA|D|angry
20|Shit.|NARRATOR|N|bitter
21|The general curses from behind her desk, and I grab onto the back of the crimson-upholstered couch to catch my balance.|NARRATOR|N|fearful
22|"Damn it, Mom, she can’t even handle her rucksack," Mira snaps, rushing to my side.|MIRA|D|angry
23|"I’m fine!"|VIOLET|D|bitter
24|My cheeks heat with mortification, and I force myself upright.|NARRATOR|N|fearful
25|She’s been back for five minutes and is already trying to save me.|NARRATOR|N|bitter
26|Because you need saving, you fool.|NARRATOR|N|bitter
27|I don’t want this.|NARRATOR|N|fearful
28|I don’t want any part of this Riders Quadrant shit.|NARRATOR|N|bitter
29|It’s not like I have a death wish.|NARRATOR|N|bitter
30|I would have been better off failing the admission test to Basgiath and going straight to the army with the majority of conscripts.|NARRATOR|N|bitter
31|But I can handle my rucksack, and I will handle myself.|NARRATOR|N|tense
32|"Oh, Violet."|MIRA|D|tender
33|Worried brown eyes look down at me as strong hands brace my shoulders.|NARRATOR|N|tender
34|"Hi, Mira."|VIOLET|D|tender

35|She might be here to say her goodbyes, but I’m just glad to see my sister for the first time in years.|NARRATOR|N|tense
36|Her eyes soften, and her fingers flex on my shoulders like she might pull me into a hug, but she steps back and turns to stand at my side, facing our mother.|NARRATOR|N|tense
37|"You can’t do this."|MIRA|D|fearful
38|"It’s already done."|MOM|D|neutral
39|Mom shrugs, the lines of her fitted black uniform rising and falling with the motion.|NARRATOR|N|neutral
40|I scoff. So much for the hope of a reprieve. Not that I ever should have expected, or even hoped for, an ounce of mercy from a woman who’s been made famous for her lack of it.|NARRATOR|N|bitter
41|"Then undo it,"|MIRA|D|angry
42|"She’s spent her whole life training to become a scribe. She wasn’t raised to be a rider."|MIRA|D|bitter
43|"Well, she certainly isn’t you, is she, Lieutenant Sorrengail?"|MOM|D|tense
44|Mom braces her hands on the immaculate surface of her desk and leans in slightly as she stands, looking us over with narrowed, appraising eyes that mirror the dragons’ carved into the furniture’s massive legs.|NARRATOR|N|tense
45|I don’t need the prohibited power of mind reading to know exactly what she sees.|NARRATOR|N|contemplative
46|At twenty-six years old, Mira’s a younger version of our mother. She’s tall, with strong, powerful muscles toned from years of sparring and hundreds of hours spent on the back of her dragon.|NARRATOR|N|contemplative
47|Her skin practically glows with health, and her golden-brown hair is sheared short for combat in the same style as Mom’s.|NARRATOR|N|contemplative
48|But more than looks, she carries the same arrogance, the unwavering conviction that she belongs in the sky.|NARRATOR|N|tense
49|She’s a rider through and through. She’s everything I’m not, and the disapproving shake of Mom’s head says she agrees.|NARRATOR|N|fearful
50|I’m too short. Too frail. What curves I do have should be muscle, and my traitorous body makes me embarrassingly vulnerable.|NARRATOR|N|somber
51|Mom walks toward us, her polished black boots gleaming in the mage lights that flicker from the sconces.|NARRATOR|N|tense
52|She picks up the end of my long braid, scoffs at the section just above my shoulders where the brown strands start to lose their warmth of color and slowly fade to a steely, metallic silver by the ends, and then drops it.|NARRATOR|N|tense
53|"Pale skin, pale eyes, pale hair."|MOM|D|fearful
54|Her gaze siphons every ounce of my confidence down to the marrow in my bones.|NARRATOR|N|fearful
55|"It’s like that fever stole all your coloring along with your strength."|MOM|D|bitter
56|Grief flashes through her eyes and her brows furrow.|NARRATOR|N|somber
57|"I told him not to keep you in that library."|MOM|D|bitter
58|It’s not the first time I’ve heard her curse the sickness that nearly killed her while she was pregnant with me or the library Dad made my second home once she’d been stationed here at Basgiath as an instructor and he as a scribe.|NARRATOR|N|tense
59|"I love that library,"|VIOLET|D|tender

# Segment 3

60|It’s been more than a year since his heart finally failed, and the Archives are still the only place that feels like home in this giant fortress, the only place where I still feel my father’s presence.|NARRATOR|N|contemplative
61|“Spoken like the daughter of a scribe,” Mom says quietly, and I see it—the woman she was while Dad was alive. Softer. Kinder…at least for her family.|MOM|D|tense
62|“I am the daughter of a scribe.” My back screams at me, so I let my pack slip from my shoulders, guiding it to the floor, and take my first full breath since leaving my room.|VIOLET|D|tense
63|Mom blinks, and that softer woman is gone, leaving only the general.|NARRATOR|N|fearful
64|“You’re the daughter of a rider, you are twenty years old, and today is Conscription Day. I let you finish your tutoring, but like I told you last spring, I will not watch one of my children enter the Scribe Quadrant, Violet.”|MOM|D|bitter
65|“Because scribes are so far beneath riders?” I grumble, knowing perfectly well that riders are the top of the social and military hierarchy.|VIOLET|D|bitter
66|“Yes!” Her customary composure slips.|MOM|D|angry
67|“And if you dare walk into the tunnel toward the Scribe Quadrant today, I will rip you out by that ridiculous braid and put you on the parapet myself.”|MOM|D|fearful
68|My stomach turns over.|VIOLET|N|tense
69|“Dad wouldn’t want this!” Mira argues, color flushing up her neck.|MIRA|D|fearful
70|“I loved your father, but he’s dead,” Mom says, as if giving the weather report.|MOM|D|neutral
71|“I doubt he wants much these days.”|MOM|D|somber
72|I suck in a breath but keep my mouth shut. Arguing will get me nowhere. She’s never listened to a damned thing I’ve had to say before, and today is no different.|NARRATOR|N|tense
73|“Sending Violet into the Riders Quadrant is tantamount to a death sentence.”|NARRATOR|N|fearful
74|Guess Mira isn’t done arguing.|NARRATOR|N|tense
75|“She’s not strong enough, Mom! She’s already broken her arm this year, she sprains some joint every other week, and she’s not tall enough to mount any dragon big enough to keep her alive in a battle.”|MIRA|D|bitter
76|“Seriously, Mira?” What. The. Hell.|VIOLET|D|angry
77|My fingernails bite into my palms as I curl my hands into fists.|VIOLET|N|fearful
78|Knowing my chances of survival are minimal is one thing. Having my sister throw my inadequacies in my face is another.|NARRATOR|N|bitter
79|“Are you calling me weak?”|VIOLET|D|angry
80|“No.” Mira squeezes my hand.|MIRA|D|tender
81|“Just…fragile.”|MIRA|D|bitter
82|That’s not any better.|VIOLET|N|bitter
83|Dragons don’t bond fragile women. They incinerate them.|VIOLET|N|fearful
84|“So she’s small.” Mom scans me up and down, taking in the generous fit of the cream belted tunic and pants I selected this morning for my potential execution.|MOM|D|tense
85|I snort.|VIOLET|D|bitter
86|“Are we just listing my faults now?”|VIOLET|D|bitter
87|“I never said it was a fault.” Mom turns to my sister. “Mira, Violet deals with more pain before lunch than you do in an entire week.”|MOM|D|contemplative
